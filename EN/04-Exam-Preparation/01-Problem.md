## Description
Create a program that checks **if some registration attempts can be processed or not**. 

Each registration consists of a **username** and a **password**.


On the **first line**, you will receive a **number that indicates how many inputs** you will receive on the **next** lines.

A **registration is valid** when:

- The username is surrounded by **"U\$"**

- The username needs to contain a **minimum of 3 characters**, to **start** with an **uppercase letter**, followed **only by lowercase letters**

- The password is surrounded by **"P@\$"**

- The password needs to start with a **minimum of 5 alphabetical characters** (not including digits) and to end with a **digit**

**Example of a valid** registration: 
- "U\$MichaelU\$P@\$asdqwe123P@\$"

You have to check if the registration is **valid**. 

- **If it is valid**, print out the following messages:
- "Registration was successful"
- "Username: \{Username\}, Password: \{Password\}"

**If it is not valid** - print out the following message:
- "Invalid username or password"

In the end, **print out the count of successful registrations**:
- "Successful registrations: \{successfulRegistrationsCount\}"

### Input

- On the first line, you will receive a number **n** - the count of input lines that you will receive
- On the next **n** lines - a text, containing an username and a password that you have to check

### Output
- Print all the expected messages, each on a new line
- In the end, print the count of successful registrations

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | Registration was successful |
| U\$MichaelU\$P@$asdqwe123P@\$ | Username: Michael, Password: asdqwe123 |
| U\$NameU$P@\$PasswordP@\$ | Invalid username or password |
| U\$UserU$P@\$ad2P@\$ | Invalid username or password |
| | Successful registrations: 1 |

### Comments
- We have 3 input lines to check:
- The first one follows the rules, so it is valid
- The second one is not valid because the password does not end with a digit
- The third one is not valid because the password is too short

### Example
| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | Registration was successful |
| U\$TommyU\$P@\$asdqwe123P@\$ | Username: Tommy, Password: asdqwe123 |
| Sara 1232412 | Invalid username or password |
| | Successful registrations: 1 |
