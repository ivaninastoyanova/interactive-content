**Firebase** is a toolset for building, improving, and growing your application.

It gives us the tools to work with most of the services developers would typically have to build themselves.

That includes **features** like analytics, authentication, databases, configuration, file storage, push messaging, etc. 

The services are **cloud-hosted** and scale with little to no effort on the developer's part.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have a **Google** account and you are **signed in**.

Click [here](https://console.firebase.google.com) to go to the **Firebase Console**.

Once you are signed in, you should be able to see this **window**:

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(19).png" /]

Create a new project by clicking on either "**Add project**" or "**Create a project**".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(2).png" /]

Type in a project **name**, for example "**TestApp**", and click "**Continue**".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(3).png" /] 

**Disable Google Analytics** as you will not need them for now.

Then, click "**Create project**".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(4).png" /]

Click "**Continue**".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(5).png" /]

Next, we need to add an App.

Add a **web application** by clicking on this sign "\<\/\>".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(6).png" /]

Type in a name for the App, for example, "**books**" and click "**Register app**".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(7).png" /]

We will get a script, which we will use later when working with the Firebase SDK.

Click "**continue to console**".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(8).png" /]

## Create a Database

Click on "**Realtime Database**".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(9).png" /]

Then click on "**Create Database**".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(10).png" /]

Press the "**Next**" button.

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(11).png" /]

Choose the option "**Start in test mode**" and click "**Enable**".

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(12).png" /]

The database is now created **successfully**.

Copy the **database URL** so that you can use it in **Postman** to create books.

# Firebase REST API CRUD Operations: Part One

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Applications/05.JS-Applications-Remote-Databases/EN/JS-apps-remote-dbs-9-10-firebase-rest-api-crud-operations-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

**CRUD** stands for **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**.

They are the four **operations** for working with **data storage**.

In this example, we will be using the **database** we created earlier in Firebase.

**Note: You may not get the same results as shown in the examples.** 

**This is because as you experiment with the database, you can enter custom data.**

# Firebase REST API CRUD Operations: Part Two

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Applications/05.JS-Applications-Remote-Databases/EN/JS-apps-remote-dbs-11-accessing-firebase-rest-api-with-postman-FIX-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

## Getting All Books

Open **Postman** and create a new request. 

Choose the **GET** method and fort the **URL**, copy and paste the following line into **Postman**:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/.json`

Or use the one below, the result will be the same:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/books.json`

Click the **Send** button to get the response from the server.

As a result, we get all of the books stored in the database.

```js
{
    "books": {
        "books": [
            null,
            {
                "author": "J.K. Rowling",
                "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone"
            },
            {
                "author": "Steven King",
                "title": "IT"
            },
            {
                "author": "Herman Melville",
                "title": "Moby-Dick"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Getting a Single Book

Next, we will retrieve a single book from the database.

Choose the **GET** method and for the **URL**, copy and paste the following line into **Postman**:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/books/books/1.json`

Click the **Send** button to get the response from the server.

As a result, we get the book at position **1** from the books array.

```js
{
    "author": "J.K. Rowling",
    "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone"
}
```

Now let us try and get the author of the book.

Choose the **GET** method and for the **URL**, copy and paste the following line into **Postman**:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/books/books/1/author.json`

Click the **Send** button to get the response from the server.

```js
"J.K. Rowling"
```

## Adding a Book

Now we will add a new book to the database using the **POST** method.

Choose the **POST** method and for the **URL**, copy and paste the following line into **Postman**:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/books.json`

Click on the **Body** button and then click on the **raw** button.

Choose the **JSON** format in the last column.

Then copy and paste the following JSON object:

```js
{
    "title": "New title",
    "author": "New author"
}
```

Here is an example of how it should look in **Postman**.

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases.png" /]

The response from the server will be an **ID**, which is a **random string**.

Here is the response from the server for our newly created book.

```js
{
    "name": "-MOpe8WgPwqaw7tdKwIN"
}
```

## Deleting a Book

Let us delete the book we have just created using the **DELETE** method.

Choose the **DELETE** method and for the **URL**, copy and paste the following line into **Postman**:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/books/-MOpe8WgPwqaw7tdKwIN.json`

"-MOpe8WgPwqaw7tdKwIN" is the **new book ID** we received when we **created** the book.

**When we create a book, we will get a different ID. Use The ID you received from the server for the example.**

The response from the server will be **200 OK**.  It also will return **null**.

## Editing a Book

The next step is to edit a book.

Choose the **PUT** method and for the **URL**, copy and paste the following line into **Postman**:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/books/2.json`

Click on the **Body** button and then click on the **raw** button.

Choose the **JSON** format in the last column.

Then copy and paste the following JSON object:

```js
{
    "title": "Edited",
    "year": 1980,
    "ISBN": "954X"
}
```

If the book **already exists** in the database, it will be updated, and the new JSON data will replace the old data.

If the book **does not exist** in the database, it will be **created**.

This is the response from the server:

```js
{
    "ISBN": "954X",
    "title": "Edited",
    "year": 1980
}
```

If we want to update only specific data, for example, to change the book author, we use the **PATCH** method.

Choose the **PATCH** method and for the **URL**, copy and paste the following line into **Postman**:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/books/2.json`

Click on the **Body** button and then click on the **raw** button.

Choose the **JSON** format in the last column.

Then copy and paste the following JSON object:

`{"year":1981, "author":"Author Changed"}`

With the **PATCH** method, we will only update the data we target with the **JSON** object.

In this example, the year will change from **1980** to **1981**, and a new **author** property will be created as well.

Here is the response from the server:

```js
{
    "year": 1981,
    "author": "Author Changed"
}
```

## Using the PUT Method

Now let us try one more example using the **PUT** method.

Choose the **PUT** method and for the **URL**, copy and paste the following line into **Postman**:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/books/2.json`

Click on the **Body** button and then click on the **raw** button.

Choose the **JSON** format in the last column.

Then copy and paste the following JSON object:

"New author was assigned"

Here is the response from the server:

```js
"New author was assigned"
```

Now, if we send a **GET** request to the server, we will get the following response:

```js
{
    "books": {
        "2": "New author was assigned",
        "books": [
            null,
            {
                "author": "J.K. Rowling",
                "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone"
            },
            {
                "author": "Steven King",
                "title": "IT"
            },
            {
                "author": "Herman Melville",
                "title": "Moby-Dick"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Be careful with the **PUT** method. Use the **PATCH** method instead.

It will update only the data passed with the JSON object.

## Deleting a Book

Finally, delete the book we created.

Choose the **DELETE** method and for the **URL**, copy and paste the following line into **Postman**:

`https://softuni-remotedb.firebaseio.com/books/2.json`

The response from the server will be **200 OK**, and it will return **null** in the **body**.

# Authentication vs. Authorization

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Applications/05.JS-Applications-Remote-Databases/EN/JS-apps-remote-dbs-12-authentication-vs-authorization-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

**Authentication** is about validating your credentials such as Username, ID, and password to verify your identity.

Authorization only occurs after your identity has been **authenticated** by the system.

This gives you **full access** to resources such as information, files, databases, etc.

# Problem with Solution: All Books

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Applications/05.JS-Applications-Remote-Databases/EN/JS-Applications-Remote-Database-Firebase-All-Books-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

To **get all** of the books, you have to use the **database URL** you received when you created the database, followed the name of the **entity**, which is "**books**", and the "**.json**" extension at end.

The method is "**GET**":

- **URL:** `https://databaseURL/books/.json`

[/slide]

# Problem with Solution: Get a Book

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Applications/05.JS-Applications-Remote-Databases/EN/JS-Applications-Remote-Database-Firebase-Get-Book-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

To get a **specific book**, choose the "**GET**" method in Postman and use the following **URL**.

- `https://databaseURL/books/{bookId}.json`

Replace `{bookId}` with the ID of the book you want to get, like **2**.

[/slide]

[slide hideTitle]

# Problem with Solution: Create Books

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Applications/05.JS-Applications-Remote-Databases/EN/JS-Applications-Remote-Database-Firebase-Create-Book-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

To create a book, we will have to send a "**POST**" request, and the JSON body should be in the following format:

```js
{
    "Author": "Steven King",
    "title": "IT"
}
```

Send the request to the following **URL:** `https://databaseURL/books/{newBookID}.json`

Put the **ID** of the **new book** between the curly brackets - **4**, for example

## Example

[image assetsSrc="Remote-Databases(14).png" /]

You can also do that **directly** from the database interface.

# Problem with Solution: Patch Book

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Applications/05.JS-Applications-Remote-Databases/EN/JS-Applications-Remote-Database-Firebase-Patch-Book-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The HTTP command "**PATCH**" modifies an existing HTTP resource.

It can also **create** the resource if it **does not exist**.

The JSON body should be in the following **format**:

```js
{
    "year": 1920,
    "author": "Someone"
}
```

- **URL:** `https://databaseURL/books/bookId/-mQM-ru804j590z/.json`

Replace the `bookId/-mQM-ru804j590z` portion with the corresponding IDs.

# Problem with Solution: Change Book Author

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Javascript/Javascript-Applications/05.JS-Applications-Remote-Databases/EN/JS-Applications-Remote-Database-Firebase-Change-Book-Author-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

The next task is to execute the "**PUT**" command. 

You can change the name to any **author** you like.

The JSON **body** should be in the following format:

```
"New Author Value"
```

Send the request to the following **URL:** `https://databaseURL/books/{bookId}/{firebaseAutoID}/author/.json`

Go to **Firebase Console** to take a look at the **results**.
