# The Event Loop

The event loop in JavaScript **detects**, **collects** and **orders** events.

It is responsible for the **function execution order**.

As the **loop** name implies, it is **continuously looking** for new events to handle.

Once a function is called, or an event is detected, a function is placed **inside the stack**.

That function stays there **until execution.**

Here is a visual representation of how the event loop operates:

# Stack Calls

As mentioned above, functions are **added to the call stack** where they **start being executed**.

In the stack, functions are executed **top-to-bottom**. 

This means that **the most recently added function will be executed first**.

The following graphic illustrates the behavior of two functions that are called one after another:

Functions can also be called **within each other**.

In that case, a function is completed **once every other function inside it has been executed**.

Events that have **event listeners** add messages to a message queue.

Every message has a **handler function**.

Here is how it happens:
