Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with their fields and methods.

An object is a **basic unit** and an **instance of a class**.

Classes define templates for **fields**, **constructors**, and **methods**.

Objects represent **real-life subjects**. 

An object has:

- **state** - Represented by **fields**

- **behavior** - Represented by **methods**, which are used for object interaction 

- **identity** - Gives a **unique name** to an object

In real life, dogs have a **breed** state and a **barking** behavior.

An object holds a set of **named values**.

A **birthday** object will have values like `day`, `month`, `year` etc.

```java live
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        LocalDate birthday = LocalDate.of(2018,5,5);
        System.out.println(birthday);
    }
}
```

# Classes

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Object-And-Classes/02.Java-Fundamentals-Objects-and-Classes/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-objects-and-classes-5-classes-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Classes and objects are the **two main aspects** of object-oriented programming. 

A class can be defined as a template that describes the behavior that the object of its type support.

Classes provide **structure the objects**. 

Classes define: 

- **Fields** (private variables) - Represent the state of an object

- **Getters/Setters** - Return or update fields

- **Methods** - Represent the behavior of an object


This is how **objects** can be derived from a **class**:

- `LocalDate` - A sample **class**

- `birthdayPeter` and `birthdayMaria` - Sample **objects**

# Real-Life Example

All entities with similar characteristics can be arranged in categories.

For example, all animals are grouped in a single **class**, and each animal is an **object** of that class.

[image assetsSrc="ObjectsAndClasses_RealLifeExample.png" /]

Each animal has similar characteristics, so the **animal** class should have the following fields: type, age, color, preferred food, etc.

Also, each animal can eat, drink water, move, make a sound, etc, so methods for each of these actions should be declared within the **animal** class.

A class is like an object constructor that contains all of their similar characteristics. 

It is a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# Objects - Instances of Classes

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Fundamentals-Object-And-Classes/02.Java-Fundamentals-Objects-and-Classes/EN/interactive-java-fundamentals-objects-and-classes-6-objects-instances-of-classes-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Creating an object based on a predefined class is called **instantiation**.

An **instance** of a class is an object created at runtime.

All instances have common **behavior**. 

To create an object: 

1) Specify the **class name** 

2) Set an **object name**

3) Use the `new` **keyword** 

```java
public class Animal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Animal("mammal");
        Animal lizard = new Animal("reptile");
    }
}
```
